Android Wallet for Cellpinda Coin users

Ethereum and ERC-20 compatible.

This App uses Infura/Etherscan/Coinmarketcap APIs, 

and requires 1 more additional API service that we implemented to support full functionality, 

but if you just want to test functionality, 

Please log-in with Test ID / Password (7777 / 7777)


Current version supports Ethereum and ERC-20 Token Balance inquiry, and its' transaction history.

ETH/ERC-20 transfer function is almost ready (Web3J, Infura API), but not yet implemented.

Please refer to Trust Wallet in order to tranfer Tokens or Ethereum.


You may reach that goal via calliing sendRawTransaction at Infura API.
